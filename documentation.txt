RADAR (Radio detection And Ranging)
is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), 
angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, 
spacecraft, guided missiles,motor vehicles,weather formations,and terrain.
A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the 
radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna
(often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver 
and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves 
(pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return  
to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed.

APPLICATION OF RADAR
The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including 
* air and terrestrial traffic control, 
* radar astronomy, 
* air-defense systems, 
* antimissile systems, 
* marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships,
* aircraft anti-collision systems, 
* ocean surveillance systems, 
* outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems,
* meteorological precipitation monitoring, 
* altimetry and flight control systems,
* guided missile target locating systems, 
** self-driving cars, and 
* ground-penetrating radar for geological observations.

* High tech radar systems are
 associated with digital signal processing, machine learning and are capable of
 extracting useful information from very high noise levels.
